# Membes contract
This repo contains [Membes Place](http://members.place) contracts. We use Binance Smart Chain for deployment.

## About
Currently, contracts are deployed via Remix hence the truffle-config file does not include any mainnet or testnet settings.

Commands:
 - `yarn test` - run local tests
 - `yarn compile` - compile contracts
 - `yarn migrate` - deploy on local dev blockchain
 - `yarn console` - open truffle console
